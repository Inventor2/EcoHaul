EcoHaul is a web-based tool aimed at encouraging sustainable transportation choices. The MVP focuses on delivering essential features to validate the core idea:

1. Carbon Footprint Estimator – Users can input travel details such as distance and transport mode (car, bike, bus, etc.) to calculate the estimated carbon emissions for their journey.


2. Eco-Friendly Suggestions – Based on the user's input, the system offers greener alternatives (e.g., biking instead of driving for short distances), helping users make environmentally conscious decisions.


3. Responsive, Minimal UI – The interface is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate, ensuring quick access to core functionality without distractions.
